# diary_Myjournal
This app lets you add basic content about how your day was. 

## Detailed Description
The application is designed to let the user record their daily thoughts. You can add a journal entry, edit it, delete those you no longer need and view all that you have entered. The information will be stored and secured locally on your phone with access restricted to the owner of the journal. This is made possible by use of Google Firebase for user registration and login.
